# Imagination Station

[Link to Site](https://seliades.github.io/Train-Schedules/)

## Description and Instructions
Using Firebase and Moment this site tracks and stores the next arrival time of any train you can imagine and lets you know how soon each train will be arriving. You can add any train you want by providing a few pieces of information in the form provided. First give your train a name and destination; then tell us when the first train runs (in military time) and how often it runs (in minutes). Hit submit and you will see what time the train will arrive, and how much longer you have to wait for it.
